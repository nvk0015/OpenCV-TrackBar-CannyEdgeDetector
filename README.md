# OpenCV-TrackBar-CannyEdgeDetector

The motivation behind developing this script is to familiarise myself using the Trackbar function from OpenCV module. 

- In normal situation a developer finds it tiresome tuning parameters, visualizing changes in output, repeating it for multiple number of times. 
- The TrackBar function from OpenCV module makes it more easy with its GUI, finding the right parameters for any algorithm allowing the developer find the right parameters in very less time compared to traditional approaches.
